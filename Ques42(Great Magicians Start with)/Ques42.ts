// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magician_name:string[]=["Criss Angel", "Derren Brown", "Penn Jillette", "Doug Henning"];

function make_great(magician_name:string[]): void{
    magician_name.forEach(magician_name => console.log("Great Magician are, ",magician_name));
}

make_great(magician_name);

console.log(magician_name);
